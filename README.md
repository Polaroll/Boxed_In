# Overview

Boxed In is a platforming game where the user controls a cube to navigate levels, jumping between platforms and 
over obstacles in order to reach the next level.

My purpose for writing this software was to develop skills around implementing libraries and further my understanding
of python. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

## Development Environment
**Pycharm**:
 Excels in python related projects. This allowed me to easily use a virtual environment (venv) to install the arcade library for this game.
